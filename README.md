## Files

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css       # Brown theme styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # App logic with APIs and local fallback
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # This file
```

## Setup

1. Download all files to the same folder (including `quotes.json`)
2. Open `index.html` in browser, or use local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

- **New Quote**: Click button to get a fresh quote
- **Share**: Copy to clipboard or use device sharing  
- **Favourite**: Add quote to favourites (max 5)
- **Remove**: Click √ó on any favourite to delete

## Browser Support

Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern versions)

## API Integration

Uses Quotable.io for quotes.
If the API is slow or offline, loads from `quotes.json`.
If both fail, uses built-in hardcoded quotes.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Quotes Not Loading
- **Issue**: No quotes appear after clicking "New Quote"
- **Solution**: Check internet connection. App will use local backup quotes if needed.
- **Debug**: Open browser dev tools and check console for API errors.

#### Favourites Not Saving
- **Issue**: Favourites disappear after browser restart
- **Solution**: Ensure local storage is enabled in browser settings.
- **Debug**: Check if localStorage is available: `console.log(typeof Storage)`

#### Share Button Not Working
- **Issue**: Share functionality doesn't work
- **Solution**: Web Share API is not supported on all browsers.
- **Fallback**: App automatically falls back to clipboard copy.

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for all features
- **Firefox**: Full support with minor visual differences
- **Safari**: Good support, Web Share API available on iOS
- **Older Browsers**: Basic functionality with fallbacks

## Potential Challenges from Vanilla JS

- Asynchronous Operations: Managing fetch requests, promises, and async/await
- Error Handling: Network failures, API rate limits, malformed responses
- State Management: Tracking current quote, loading states, user preferences
- DOM Manipulation: Updating elements efficiently
- CORS Issues: Some quote APIs may have restrictions
